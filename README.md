## Project objective

- The challenge is to create a personal portfolio page that you can update throughout the bootcamp with skills and details you learn as you progress through the modules.

## Description / Project Brief

Using the skill we learnt in week 3 we were asked to re-create our personal portfolio using Bootstrap components.

I decided to keep to my original design scheme as I liked the look and feel of this

I started off by inserting a Bootstrap Jumbotron and then slowly built ontop of this to re-create my portfolio.

My project includes all of the following:

- A navigation bar and menu
- Hero / Jumbotron section
- A grid section which displays my past projects and Interests
  - This will later be updated with other projects I build within the bootcamp
  - The grid section includes Bootstrap cards for each project/interest
- Skills section highlighting subjects we've covered so far as well as subjects we will be due to cover
  - I included a progress bar for each subject and gave my self a percentage indicator on how comfortable I feel I am on each subject.
- About section with a brief description of who I am and my hobbies and interests

## Thought Process

I wanted to create a clean and simple layout with advanced functionality to navigate my site as it will be built on over the course of the bootcamp.

I want to incorporate unique design elements and a standout factor to attract potential future clients.

My interest in design has been a contributing factor on how I see layouts and what I want my work to present.

Improvements I will look to make would be to add a hamburger menu when viewed in a small screen size and incorporate icons and additional advanced features.

As I have not yet been introduced to bootstrap and icons in my contact section I substituted this for a way to display an image which links to my contact info.

## Initial Wireframe Design

I created my wireframe design using Procreate on Ipad Pro.

I did a mock up of how I wanted to structure the page to give a look and feel of the end result.

Check out my initial layout below
